Installation
============

Installing and using the ``Zgoubidoo`` Python library requires a working Python 3.7+ environment.

The easiest way is to proceed with ``conda`` to set it up. In case you already have a Python 3.7 environment available,
you can simply install ``Zgoubidoo`` with ``pip`` directly. ``Zgoubidoo`` has a relatively small number of
dependencies, and no non-Python dependencies, except of course for ``Zgoubi`` itself. Detailed step-by-step
instructions are provided in the following sections.
